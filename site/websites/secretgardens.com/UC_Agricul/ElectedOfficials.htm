              if it is a short note. Numbers count in politics. <strong>The most 
              important thing is that we get one more vote on the Santa Clara 
              City Council to Keep Some of the Land Zoned Agriculture. Try to

              <strong>CITY</strong><br>
              THE TWO MOST LIKELY SANTA CLARA COUNCIL MEMBERS TO VOTE FOR AT LEAST 
              SOME LAND REMAINING ZONED AS AGRICULTURE ARE ALDYTH PARLE AND ROD 
              DIRIDON, JR . Aldyth Parle is the oldest council member and is focused 
              on Senior Housing. She should be happy because senior housing appears 
              to be happening on the property. It is possible she would vote supporting 
              some land remaining zoned agriculture. Creating a unique situation 
              for seniors (like activities for children, gardens and garden classes, 
              senior horticultural therapy programs, a historical museum) might 
              get her interested in saving some of the land. Council Member, Rod 
              Diridon, Jr., is the only council member who has run for a state 
              office (in 2002 he ran against Sally Lieber for State Assembly and 
              lost). Because of his regional interests and his father's notoriety 
              (San Jose train station is named after his father), he could be 
              influenced to vote to keep some of the land zoned in agriculture 
              instead of keeping it all in housing. He has also asked us about 
              sources of funding for open space for the property which we have 
              given him. He is an important swing vote and needs to hear from 
              us. In February the three city council members who voted in favour 
              of open space are Mayor Patricia Mahan, John McLemore, and Dominic 
              Caserta. The other four voted for housing with research as to possible 
              open space funding ideas (which has not yet been done satisfactorily 
              even after 3 &frac12; months). The two most unlikely candidates 
              to vote for open space are Jamie Matthews, who received campaign 
              money from the State&#8217;s consultants and a great deal of money 
              from developers outside the Valley, and Patrick Kolstad, the only 
              Republican council member. The City&#8217;s Ethical Code frowns 
              on council members receiving campaign money on issues they vote 
              on. For this reason, it is hoped that Jamie Matthews is forced to 
              recuse himself from voting on the BAREC issues. If he recuses himself, 
              the vote will be a tie. </font></font><br>
              <font color="#000000" size="2"> <br>
              <strong>STATE</strong> <br>
              The two that represent the BAREC property are Senator John Vasconcellos 
              and Assembly Member Rebecca Cohn. Neither have strong interests 
              in the property nor are they strong on environmental and land use 
              issues. Senator Vasconcellos has 1 &frac12; years left in his term. 
              Assembly Member Sally Leiber represents most of the City of Santa 
              Clara but not the exact location of the property. She feels there 
              is a problem because there are Assembly rules against going into 
              another elected official's district, in this case Rebecca Cohn&#8217;s 
              district. The strange shapes of the State Assembly and Senate Districts 
              makes this a very real problem for BAREC. However, if they really 
              see the value to their constitutients, they can do anything and 
              this is just an excuse. Sally Lieber has interests more in line 
              with the BAREC property (environmental, health, open space, sustainability, 
              non-traditional learners, and &#8220;enhancing local government&#8217;s 
              collaboration with our schools and community organizations&#8221;) 
              than Cohn and Vasconcellos. Assembly Member Joe Smitian and Senator 
              Byron Sher are both former Palo Alto mayors and represent northern 
              Santa Clara County. Senator Sher is a former Stanford law professor, 
              Chairman of the Environmental Quality Committee with interests in 
              natural areas and not agriculture and urban ecology. He is on the 
              Budget Review Committee. He will be termed out in 1 &frac12; years 
              and is concentrating on the Valley&#8217;s linear creek trails and 
              the Salt Marshes. Assemblyman Smitian is currently the most interested. 
              His interests, more than any other elected official, are aligned 
              with the BAREC property. He has degrees in law and city planning, 
              was School Board President, Santa Clara County Supervisor, is on 
              the Budget Subcommitte for Education Finance, and received UC&#8217;s 
              2002 Legislator of the Year award. He will be running for the Senate 
              seat of Senator Sher. We will be fortunate to have him help us. 
              Rebecca Cohn and former Assembly Member Elaine Alquist will be running 
              for Vasconcellos&#8217; Senate. Alquist followed Vasconcellos when 
              he was termed out of his Assembly seat and, therefore, is probably 
              aligned with Vasconcellos to obtain his endorsement.. She was on 
              the Cupertino School Board so has strong interests in education. 
              She was Chairman of the Assembly Committee on Ageing and also the 
              Technology Information Committee. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>FEDERAL</strong><br>
              U.S. Representative Zoe Lofgren and U. S. Representative Mike Honda 
              represent the region on the federal level. Both are on the Science 
              Committee and are interested in Education and Technology. Representative 
              Lofgren was a lawyer and taught law at Santa Clara University. Their 
              contributions could be the following: (1) Funding sources in particular 
              the $1 Billion available from the Federal Farmland Protection Program; 
              (2) National historical status for both the 1920 house and for the 
              agricultural land; (3) What governmental organization replaced the 
              national Grand Army of the Republic? If it was the Federal Department 
              of Veteran Affairs, then the federal government owns one of several 
              parcels of this land because the land was given to the Women&#8217;s 
              Relief Corps, the local organization for the Grand Army of the Republic. 
              Also, the money to build the 1920&#8217;s building was raised by 
              the Women&#8217;s Relief Corps. (4) Given the 1860&#8217;s federal 
              government&#8217;s Land Grant College system, is it possible to 
              remove a UC agricultural research facility for California's Central 
              Coast Bioregion and not replace it? <br>
